# Conveyor-Belt-Fault-Detection-System
This project focuses on detecting wear and tear in conveyor belts while simultaneously measuring belt thickness. By providing real-time insights into belt health, the system helps prevent unexpected failures, minimizes downtime, and ensures smoother operation of production systems.

Technologies used:
Hardware: ESP32 Camera Module, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, Arduino Uno.
Software: Python, TensorFlow, Arduino IDE, Local Webpage Dashboard.
AI Model: InceptionV3 for image recognition and fault classification.

Features:
Real-time detection of conveyor belt damage using a camera module.
Thickness measurement of the belt using an ultrasonic sensor.
Automated alerts for detected faults.
Classification of damage severity (e.g., normal, slightly damaged, moderately damaged, severely damaged).
Data monitoring via a local webpage integrated with IoT.
Automated system shutdown for severe faults.
